# Box Notes Reader
This is a little apllication developed  with Electronjs aimed to read Box Notes synchronized on local machine when no connection to Internet is available to open the notes on Box Notes web editor.

Because the Box Drive application is available only for Windos and Mac, only the build for Windows is available for now.
