# Box Notes Reader
This is a little apllication developed  with Electronjs aimed to read Box Notes synchronized on local machine when no connection to Internet is available to open the notes on Box Notes web editor.

Because the Box Drive application is available only for Windos and Mac,  for now only the build for Windows is available.

You can set the application as default app to open .notebox files instead of the online Box Notes editor.
